# BootBF
Have you ever wanted to make an OS in BrainF? Now you can! BootBF is a x86 assembly implementation of BrainF
so that you can run all of your BrainF code as an OS. It is fully compatible with any other BrainF implementation.
# Usage
There are two built-in programs: cat and hello world. To compile either one of those, use `make cat` or `make hello`. Once 
you have compiled a program, you run the generated file `bootbf.bin` using any x86 emulator. For example, with `qemu`, you would use`qemu-system-i386 bootbf.bin`. If you want to compile your own program, you can use a similar process: give it a `.b` extension, and then use `make myfile.b` to generate a binary.
# Specs

- All code generated by BootBF is designed to run in 16-bit real mode. It uses the BIOS interrupts for input and output.
- The code is loaded at 0x7e00, right after the bootsector. The program's memory begins at 0x9000 and spans all of the 16 bit addresses. This means that with enough `>` instructions, one could implement self-modifying code.
- Each cell is 8 bits and wraps. Memory does not wrap.
- `[` and `]` instructions may only be nested up to 255 times.
